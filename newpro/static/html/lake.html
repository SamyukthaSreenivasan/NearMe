Avadi Lake lies right behind the Tamil Nadu Housing Board (TNHB) and Thirumullaivoyal. This lake is of length of 2.64 kilometers and covers an area of 8 acres before the restoration. It is mostly known to have never dried up in many years. This lake has supposedly been a source of water for cultivation of farm lands long before. The water body attracts many birds during various seasons.
The lake is fed by surplus water from the unpolluted stretch of the Cooum River. The lake serves as a source for groundwater recharge in the neighbouring areas, such as Adhiparasakthi Nagar and Govardhanagiri.The average depth is 12 feet.
However, in recent decades the lake has lost most of its area to indiscriminate building and encroachment. These are the major problems at present, since the water of the monsoon showers moves inside of the buildings as they are in the area of the lake
